            <p>Did you know? "Baby Driver" was not only an action-packed film but also a musical experience. Director Edgar Wright had the actors wear earpieces during the filming of certain scenes to synchronize their movements with the music playing in the background. This unique approach allowed the actors to stay in rhythm with the beats, resulting in seamless and visually captivating sequences that seamlessly blended action and music.</p>
